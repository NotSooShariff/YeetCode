# üìö YeetCode: LeetCode Solutions in Python

Welcome to YeetCode! This repository is dedicated to providing comprehensive Python solutions for LeetCode problems, specifically designed for complete beginners. Each problem's solution is housed in its own directory, making it easy for you to find the explanations and code you need.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

The repository structure follows the format of "Problem Number. Problem Name." For example:

- `1. Two Sum`
- `2. Add Two Numbers`
- ...

Inside each directory, you will find a Markdown file (`.md`) that offers a detailed explanation of the problem and a Python solution heavily commented for easy comprehension.

## üìñ Problem Descriptions and Code

To access the solutions and explanations, simply navigate to the corresponding directory of the problem you're interested in. There, you will find a comprehensive Markdown file with a detailed problem description, Python code, and thorough comments to help you understand the solution step by step.

As an example, you can check out the [Two Sum problem](https://github.com/NotSooShariff/YeetCode/blob/main/1.%20Two%20Sum/Naive.md) to see the format and depth of our explanations.

## üé• Video Solutions

In addition to written explanations and code, we have provided video solution links for some problems. These videos offer alternative ways to approach and solve the problems, providing you with multiple learning resources.

## üîë Prerequisite Knowledge

In the last section of each problem's explanation, we list the fundamental topics and concepts that will help you better understand the solution. If a problem requires a good understanding of data structures like linked lists, arrays, or algorithms, we make sure to guide you on where to start.
